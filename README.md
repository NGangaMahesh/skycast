### Known Issues or Limitations

- The application currently supports only a limited set of weather data provided by the OpenWeatherMap API.


### Brief Description of the Approach

The application is structured as follows:

1. **App Component**: This is the main component that manages the state for dark mode and weather data. It also handles fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

2. **CurrentTemperature Component**: This component displays the current weather details for the selected city. It uses custom icons for weather conditions and provides a detailed view of the current weather.

3. **WeatherForecast Component**: This component displays the weather forecast for the upcoming days. It uses a grid layout to show multiple forecasts and provides detailed weather information for each day.

4. **Dark Mode Toggle**: A simple toggle switch to switch between light and dark modes. This improves the visual experience, especially in low-light environments.
